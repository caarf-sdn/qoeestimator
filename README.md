# Caarf-SDN QoE Estimator

The intensive use of existing IP networks requires an optimized management of the available resources of the network infrastructure in order to allow the coexistence of multiple types of traffic ensuring their proposed service levels (SLA). In recent years there has been a considerable increase in the availability of bandwidth, storage and processing capacity, which has motivated the emergence of new applications, new end-user devices, mobile communication, etc. Unfortunately, network infrastructure and routing strategies have not evolved at the same pace as applications and their demands. As a result, network infrastructure is constantly under scarcity of resources and hence under constant congestion, not fully meeting the demands of network utilisation, which are shifting from data-driven demands to service-centric dynamic demands accessed by fixed and mobile users with a significant increase in traffic demands under highly heterogeneous environments. . However, due to the converging nature of digital architectures, to the increasing demand for real-time sensitive traffic such as voip and other multimedia applications, and to a greater user adaptability relative to the use of new technologies, solutions based only on Quality of Service (QoS) appear to be insufficient to meet user requirements. In fact, QoS metrics are centered on the network, describing the nature of the traffic (using metrics such as throughtput, delay, jitter, etc.). The concept of context-based networks enriches the traffic management since it considers users, network and end-user devices requirements, providing a generic and cutting-edge approach for traffic optimization. In this work, the Software Defined Networks (SDN) paradigm provides the required mechanisms for the implementation of a dynamic control architecture and management of network resources due to the decoupling of control plan and routing plan.Nevertheless, flowtable configuration within SDNsÂ´controllers is still carried out statically, which does not allow the description of the dynamic nature of context-based networks.Therefore, in this work we propose the application of a user-centric (context-based) optimization solution to SDNs called Context-Aware Adaptive Routing Framework (CAARF-SDN). Within CAARF-SDN the concepts of Quality of Service (QoS), Quality of Experience (QoE), Quality of Device (QoD), Quality of Context (QoC), and adaptive routing are integrated to provide a dynamic and proactive approach for the delivery of context-sensitive traffic.
